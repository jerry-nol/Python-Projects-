Basic Python Projects

Here are my basic Python projects that I have created. They use modules such as tkinter and sqlite3 and a the framework of Django.

PROJECTS:

~ File Transfer Gui
~ Phonebook
~ Bank

FILE TRANSFER GUI:
This project allows the user to select all .txt files that have been recently created or updated within the last 24 hours from one choosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in the database.


PHONEBOOK:
The Phonebook project functions as a literal phone book for a user. It lets the user save a contact's name, phone number, and email address in the database and allows the user to delete and update any contact that has been perviously stored. 
 

BANK:
This project lets the user create an account and lets them add any money amount they want. The user can also make transactions to there account whether it is a deposit or a withdrawal. This app will allow the user to see all previous transactions they have made as well. The super user has access to all accounts and can create, read, update, and delete any account they want.
